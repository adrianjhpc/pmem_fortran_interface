# PMDK Fortran Interface
This repository implements a Fortran interface to the `libpmem` library from the PMDK set of libraries.

The aim is to allow persistent memory to be programmed directly from Fortran, rather than requiring every Fortran code developer to create their own interface or C/C++ code to exploit this functionality.
